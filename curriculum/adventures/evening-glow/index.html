            <span>
                He climbs the mountain, stone and stride,<br>
With heartbeats loud and breath as guide,<br>
Through crags and cliffs, through trails unknown,<br>
To heights where whispered winds are blown.
            </span>
            <span>
                The sun is sinking, low and gold,<br>
The peak is near, the sky unfolds,<br>
His muscles ache, his spirit soars,<br>
With every step, the summit roars.
            </span>
            <span>
                At last he stands where earth meets sky,<br>
A silent witness to the high,<br>
He turns to gaze, his heart aglow,<br>
Into the valley’s twilight show.
            </span>
            <span>
                A canvas spread in hues profound,<br>
Where day’s last light and shadows blend,<br>
The valley lies in amber tones,<br>
A realm of peace where silence moans.
            </span>
            <span>
                Mountains cradle valleys deep,<br>
In shades of dusk where secrets sleep,<br>
The rivers gleam like liquid fire,<br>
A tranquil sea of light and desire.
            </span>
            <span>
                He breathes the chill of twilight’s breath,<br>
In awe of beauty’s subtle depth,<br>
The world unfolds, serene and vast,<br>
A fleeting moment, bound to last.
            </span>
            <span>
                The sun’s embrace begins to fade,<br>
In colors rich, a twilight braid,<br>
He stands alone, yet not apart,<br>
The sunset’s glow, a balm to heart.<br>
With night approaching, calm and clear,<br>
He savors dusk, a realm sincere,<br>
For in this fleeting, golden hour,<br>
He’s touched by grace, and strength empowered.
