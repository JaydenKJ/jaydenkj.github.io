                Upon the sandy shoreline, where the ocean meets the land,<br>
Lie treasures of the deep blue, shaped by nature's hand.<br>
Shells of every color, from ivory white to pink,<br>
Hold secrets of the sea within their spiral links.
            </span>
            <span>
                Each shell tells a story, a whisper from the waves,<br>
Of ocean currents wandering through ancient underwater caves.<br>
From tiny, speckled cowries to the conch’s hollowed sound,<br>
They carry echoes of the sea, where mysteries abound.
            </span>
            <span>
                Smooth and polished by the tide, each shell is a little gem,<br>
A snapshot of the ocean’s heart, a treasure at the rim.<br>
Collected by the beachcomber, or left for tides to claim,<br>
These sea-worn fragments speak to us, and call us by name.
            </span>
            <span>
                So gather up these wonders, and let their beauty show,<br>
The ocean’s endless artistry in each soft ebb and flow.<br>
For in their fragile patterns, a timeless truth is told—<br>
The sea’s great gift of wonder, both precious and bold.
