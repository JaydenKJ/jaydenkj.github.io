                As you wander far and wide,<br>
With adventure as your guide,<br>
In every climb and every quest,<br>
Let Godâ€™s presence be your rest.

            </span>
            <span>
                When the stars light up the night,<br>
Or the dawn brings morning light,<br>
Hold His love within your thought,<br>
In every moment, seek and sought.
            </span>
            <span>
                For in each path and thrilling quest,<br>
                Let faith and wonder find their rest.<br>
                Remember God, both near and far,<br>
                Guiding you, your shining star.
